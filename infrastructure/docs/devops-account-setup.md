# Devops account

Create a _devops_ account. Once the IAM permissions are set, every other operation can be done by infrastructure automation.

Go to _IAM > Policies_ and click _Create policy_.
Choose name `${PROJECT_SHORT_NAME}-devops-policy`, for instance _ggbot-devops-policy_.
Add the following JSON.

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": ["iam:GetPolicy", "iam:GetPolicyVersion"],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

TODO notice the wildcard in Resource will be fixed on infrastructure test step below

TODO add also permissions to update policy.

Go to _IAM > Users_ and click _Create user_.
As user name, choose `${PROJECT_SHORT_NAME}-devops`, for instance _ggbot-devops_.
On "Set permissions" choose "Attach policies directly" and choose previously created policy.

Once the user is created, go to user IAM page, for instance _IAM > Users > ggbot-devops_. Go to _Security credentials_ tab and click _Create access key_.
Get the access keys and set environment variables:

-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
-   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

To check devops policy run

```sh
npm run test_infrastructure:aws:bootstrap
```

Of course, the test is expected to fail on first run. To update devops policy run

```sh
TODO npm run push_infrastructure:aws:bootstrap
```
